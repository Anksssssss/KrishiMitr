# KrishiMitr

• Created an Android application using Kotlin and Android Studio to help the farmers identify the diseases of their crop and connect them to an expert

• It has a signup/login feature via phone number or email using firebase authentication.

• The user can take an image of the diseased crop and the integerated ML model in the app will detect the disease that the crop had got

• Next the openAi api will give information about that particular disease.

• Furthermore an expert will be assigned and the user can chat with him/her for the solution to their problem.

• A fully functional chat system is built using firebase.

• Used MVVM Architecture along with Retrofit ,Room, Coroutines and Navigation Componenets.
